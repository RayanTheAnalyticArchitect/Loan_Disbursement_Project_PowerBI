# Loan_Disbursement_Project_PowerBI
This Power BI project analyzes loan disbursement trends over six months, focusing on monthly disbursements, performance by loan officer, and portfolio risk. It features interactive visualizations and filters, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into lending patterns and make data-driven decisions for improved financial management.

**Project Description:**
This Power BI project focuses on Loan Disbursement Analysis aimed at evaluating and visualizing the loan disbursement trends over the past six months. It highlights essential metrics such as monthly disbursements, disbursements per loan officer, and portfolio risk. The project also incorporates various visualizations to facilitate data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

**Detailed Analysis:**
Monthly Disbursements:
The project provides insights into the total loan disbursements in Euros for the last six months. This measure helps in understanding the lending trends and identifying any seasonal fluctuations in disbursements.
Data Visualization: A line or bar chart would effectively depict the monthly trends, allowing for quick visual assessments of performance over time.

**Disbursements Per Loan Officer:**
This section analyzes the performance of individual loan officers by counting the number of loans disbursed in the last month and calculating the total disbursement amount (sum of principal_amount_eur).
Data Visualization: A column chart or a stacked bar chart can illustrate this data effectively, making it easy to compare the performance of different loan officers and identify top performers.

**Portfolio at Risk:**
This metric assesses the portfolio's health by calculating the ratio of overdue loans (greater than 30 days) to the total outstanding amount (principal_amount_outstanding_eur).
Data Visualization: A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) visual can succinctly communicate the risk level, enabling quick assessment of the portfolio's stability.

**Data Filtering:**
The project allows users to filter data based on branch keys, products, and loan officers. This functionality enhances the analysis, enabling stakeholders to drill down into specific areas of interest.
User Experience: Implementing slicers and filters will facilitate interactive reports, allowing users to customize their views according to their specific requirements.

**Development Steps:**
The development process involves understanding the data sources, deciding on how to consume the data, and analyzing it to identify relevant dimensions and facts. The use of Power Query helps refine the dataset by removing unwanted columns and optimizing it for reporting.
Finally, deploying the report through Power BI services ensures accessibility and usability for stakeholders.

**Conclusion:**
This Power BI project exemplifies a structured approach to loan disbursement analysis, providing valuable insights that can guide strategic decisions within the lending sector. Through effective visualization and interaction, users can gain a comprehensive understanding of their loan portfolio's dynamics.
